# Proof Of Concept!
# Create an AWS Amplify static website from a template static web site
#
# Please see Readme.MD for background

# PREREQUISITES:
#   - github and AWS accounts set up 
#   - AWS Secret Manager set up with a personal github tokens
#   - AWS profile set up on your local machine
#   - github SSH set up on your local machine
#   - jq and git installed

# FUNCTION: wait_for_Amplify_application
# Wait for Amplify application to be created.  If it is not found within a certain
# period of time, exit.
