# Delete Static Website  CAUTION: There is no recovery from this operation
# This script was created for a scenario where the entire static
# website is created from a template.  If you run this script,
# you will lose any work done on github, git local, and the Amplify app

# see create-static.sh for addtional details

# Presumes to run this script out of current directory
DEV_OPS_ROOT=$PWD

# local git repository will be deleted at this directory point

# Default region unless specified as $2 on command line
AWS_REGION="us-west-2"

# AWS Secret Manager tokens for delete static-web-site github.

# create-static-site.sh uses an AWS Secret Manager "createtoken".  I don't
# recommend giving createtoken , which is used by Amplify, delete rights.
# If you are going to destroy the static website stack using this script, 
# then I recommend that you create a different personal github token
# specifically with delete rights.

# Note that if you use this script, you must also have the github user name in
# AWS Secrets Manager.  In create-static-website, we didn't need the username to
# create the repo.
